# Guardia-2---Project-5---Financial-Fraud-Analysis

This project aims to train a Machine Learning Algorithm to recognize financial fraud. 
In order to do this we use Scikit Learn. 

It is important to note that for this code to work, you are going to need to download the Data Set, as it is too big for GitHub.
You can found the Data Set here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1
You shall put it into a "data_set" directory and name it "financial_fraud.csv" (or change the concerned line in the code)

For this project, you also need to download both Pandas and Scikit Learn libraries.
You can do this with these commands : 

pip install pandas

pip install -U scikit-learn
